## üõ†Ô∏è Business Task

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 6 key datasets for this case study:

### **```runners```**
<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The runners table shows the **```registration_date```** for each new runner.


|runner_id|registration_date|

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

### **Q1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)**
```SQL
SELECT 
    WEEK(registration_date) as weeks, COUNT(runner_id) as signups
FROM
    runners

```

| week | signups |
|------|---------|
| 0    | 1       |
| 1    | 2       |
| 2    | 1       |

### **Q2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
```SQL

| 3         | 10                  |

### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
```SQL
WITH runners_pickup AS (
  SELECT
    ro.runner_id,
    co.order_id, 
    co.order_time, 
    ro.pickup_time, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, co.order_time, ro.pickup_time) AS pickup_minutes,
    count(pizza_id) as no_orderd_pizza	
  FROM customer_orders co

  GROUP BY 1,2,3,4)
  
SELECT 
  no_orderd_pizza,
  ROUND(AVG(pickup_minutes)) AS average_time
FROM runners_pickup
GROUP BY 1;
```

| no_order_pizza     | average_time    |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1                  | 12              |
| 2                  | 18              |
| 3                  | 29              |
 
# Finding: If more data points were available, we could plot the data on a graph and analyze the trend to identify the relationship between pizzas and avg time  more clearly. Nonetheless, from the given data, we can only conclude that there is a positive correlation between the number of pizzas ordered and the average preparation time. More pizza, more average preparing time.

### **Q4. What was the average distance travelled for each runner?**
```SQL
SELECT 
    co.customer_id, ROUND(AVG(ro.distance), 1) AS avg_distance
FROM
    runner_orders ro
        JOIN
    customer_orders co ON ro.order_id = co.order_id
GROUP BY 1;
```

| customer_id | avg_distance |
|-------------|--------------|
| 101         | 13.3         |
| 102         | 16.7         |
| 103         | 17.5         |
| 104         | 10           |
| 105         | 25           |

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
SELECT
  MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS difference
FROM runner_orders;
```

| difference |
|------------|
| 30         |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
SELECT 
    ro.runner_id,
    ro.order_id,
    ro.distance,
    ro.duration,
    COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS no_pizzas,
    ROUND(AVG(60 * ro.distance / ro.duration), 1) AS avg_speed
FROM
    customer_orders co
        JOIN
    runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE
    ro.cancellation NOT IN ('Restaurant Cancellation' , 'Customer Cancellation')
GROUP BY 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
ORDER BY 1 , 2 , 6;
```

| runner_id | order_id  | distance  | duration | no_pizzas | avg_speed |
|---------- |-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 1         | 20        | 32       | 1         | 37.5      |
| 1         | 2         | 20        | 27       | 1         | 44.4      |
| 1         | 3         | 13.4      | 20       | 2         | 40.2      |
| 1         | 10        | 10        | 10       | 2         | 60        |
| 2         | 4         | 23.4      | 40       | 3         | 35.1      |
| 2         | 7         | 25        | 25       | 1         | 60        |
| 2         | 8         | 23.4      | 15       | 1         | 93.6      |
| 3         | 5         | 10        | 15       | 1         | 40        |

**Finding:**
- #NOTE: DURATION(MINUTE)
- Runners had an average speed from 35.1 km/h to 44.4km/h,
>*there is no clear trend that the number of pizzas affects the delivery speed of an order.*
  

### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(pickup_time) AS suc_deliveries,
    100 * COUNT(pickup_time) / COUNT(order_id) AS suc_pct
FROM
    runner_orders
GROUP BY 1;
```

| runner_id | total_orders | suc_deliveries| suc_pct          |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1         | 4            | 4             | 100              |
| 2         | 4            | 3             | 75               |
| 3         | 2            | 1             | 50               |

### Data cleaning
**1. Because we cannot match directly toppings_name and topping_id so we have to  create a new temporary table #toppingsBreak to separate toppings into multiple rows**
```TSQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS toppingsBreak;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE toppingsBreak AS
SELECT 
  pizza_id,
  TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(toppings, ',', n), ',', -1)) AS topping_id,
  pt.topping_name
FROM pizza_recipes pr
CROSS JOIN (
  SELECT 1 AS n UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
) AS numbers
JOIN pizza_toppings pt
  ON TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(toppings, ',', n), ',', -1)) = pt.topping_id
WHERE n <= 1 + (LENGTH(toppings) - LENGTH(REPLACE(toppings, ',', '')));

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    toppingsBreak;
```

### Q4.Generate an order item for each record in the ```customers_orders``` table in the format of one of the following
* ```Meat Lovers```
* ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef```
* ```Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon```
* ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers```

To solve this question:
* Create 3 CTEs: ```extras_cte```, ```exclusions_cte```, and ```union_cte``` combining two tables
* Use the ```union_cte``` to LEFT JOIN with the ```customer_orders_temp``` and JOIN with the ```pizza_name```
* Use the ```CONCAT_WS``` with ```STRING_AGG``` to get the result

```TSQL

### Q5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the ```customer_orders``` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.
* For example: ```"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"```

To solve this question:
* Create a CTE in which each line displays an ingredient for an ordered pizza (add '2x' for extras and remove exclusions as well)
* Use ```CONCAT``` and ```STRING_AGG``` to get the result

```TSQL
WITH ingredients AS (
  SELECT 
    c.*,
    p.pizza_name,

    -- Add '2x' in front of topping_names if their topping_id appear in the #extrasBreak table
    CASE WHEN t.topping_id IN (
          SELECT extra_id 
          FROM #extrasBreak e 
          WHERE e.record_id = c.record_id)
      THEN '2x' + t.topping_name
      ELSE t.topping_name
    END AS topping

  FROM #customer_orders_temp c
  JOIN #toppingsBreak t
    ON t.pizza_id = c.pizza_id
  JOIN pizza_names p
    ON p.pizza_id = c.pizza_id

  -- Exclude toppings if their topping_id appear in the #exclusionBreak table
  WHERE t.topping_id NOT IN (
      SELECT exclusion_id

### Q6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
To solve this question:
* Create a CTE to record the number of times each ingredient was used
  * if extra ingredient, add 2 
  * if excluded ingredient, add 0
  * no extras or no exclusions, add 1
```TSQL
WITH frequentIngredients AS (
  SELECT 
    c.record_id,
